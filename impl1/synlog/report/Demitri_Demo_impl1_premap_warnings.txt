@W: MT529 :"d:\mystuff\projects\forth_processor2-lattice - dg\diamond\demitri demo\impl1\source\forth_proc.sv":377:0:377:8|Found inferred clock ForthProc|clk which controls 427 sequential elements including state[11]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
