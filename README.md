# AI-Robotics
The vision of this group is to create a Forth based AI Computer where you can communicate with the system using an English conversational approach.  We will add many high level Words for string manipulation, arrays, and other structures as we develop this computer.  We will extend Forth to include AI words too.  All of this will be built into FPGAs which are really parallel computers written in Behavioral System Verilog (the Assembler).
